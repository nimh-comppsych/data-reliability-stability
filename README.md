#Reliability Stability Description

This package takes a data file and gives the reliability and stability of three columns.

Continuous Integration - Build Status - "build passing" indicates that the project's tests all pass as expected. If you see that the build for a project is "broken" it means the software does not work as advertised! This is a clear sign that you should not be using it (until it gets fixed!) ... check the repo's issues to see if it's a known problem, if not, report it! We use CircleCI for our CI.
